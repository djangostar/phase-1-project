# Chuck Norris Random Facts

Your go to source for random Chuck Norris Jokes, in my opinion these are facts...


## WHY?

Chuck Norris is a legend and I love jokes. Through this process of creating my very first project through three months of intense Javascript and DOM training, I thought, what could be more appropriate than to have a random Chuck Norris joke(facts) generator? He was at the top of his craft and even fought the Legendary Bruce Lee. 

Features of this app are simple, you click the button and it provides you with a random Chuck Norris joke, then you decide if you like it or not. Simple yet neccessary as we all need a laugh every once in a while. It is also a reminder as to why I started coding in the first place, to become the best at my craft.

## Features

1. Click on the very top where it says 'Click for Chuck Norris FACTS' and a new picture with a button that says generate, click it and it will display a random Chuck Norris joke with an avatar and another button with the option to delete the joke. 

2. On the top right of the nav bar you will see a Restart link and a Heart icon; the Restart link will take you rigth back to the beginning template without having to refresh the page and the heart icon will display an alert thanking those who have been there through this whole process.

3. The event listeners I chose are; 'DOMContentLoaded', 'click', and 'alert'

4. I chose very vibrant 80's style colors being that good ol' chuck was most popular during that time.
